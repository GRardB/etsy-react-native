# Etsy Guessing Game

This is one of the only ideas I can come up with for use of the Etsy API. I'm
not creative at all.

If you feel like running this for some reason, just make sure to obtain an Etsy
API key and:

    cp app/etsy/config.js{.example,}

After that, put your API key in `app/etsy/config.js`.

If you're reading my code, be warned: it's my first attempt at React Native, and
one of my first attempts at both React and Redux. Let me know if there are
better conventions for things I did.
